# LOBICO
## LOBICO in MATLAB, plot in R
### What's it
- A script used to convert the gene expression matrix into binary, hence to apply LOBICO to find the logic model
- Without complex machine learning, you can get the simple logic model of genes to detect different cancers.
- The LOBICO model will depends on CPLEX

### How to use
- Run start.sh in shell
- Find the results in ~/Output
- Further plotting which includes logic gates need to be mannually added
